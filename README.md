# RitensePetStoreManager

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.1.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Personal notes

The API is a little bit janky, the returning PhotoURLs are strings like 'string', '112' or '/tmp/blah/blah'. This made me change up the view of the project. 
Instead of opting for a card based list I decided to go for a good old table to present the data.

I immediately went out of my way to create a custom palette, however not having a whole lot of experience with Angular Material Design I did not create a custom palette for Angular Material.
This made the CSS part a little bit hacky at some places by using !important.
